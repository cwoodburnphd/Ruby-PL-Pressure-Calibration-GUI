# Ruby-PL-Pressure-Calibration-GUI
An on-demand GUI for pressure calibrations using dual ruby photoluminescence spectra. Temperature corrections are available based on user input.
Iterations will be available for users that need a simple calibration, a dual calibration, or a calibration with a temperature correction.

Will be updated by end of September 2025.
